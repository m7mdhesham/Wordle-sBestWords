# Wordle-sBestWords
Wordle is a web-based word game developed by Josh Wardle. Players have six attempts to guess a five-letter word, with feedback given for each guess in the form of colored tiles indicating when letters match or occupy the correct position. What is the best word (or group of words) to start with that would make me the most likely to reach the desired word quickly?
